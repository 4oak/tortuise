A CPU-first 3D Gaussian Splatting viewer inspired by [ratatui](https://github.com/ratatui/ratatui), built on [crossterm](https://github.com/crossterm-rs/crossterm). Fully parallelized rendering pipeline via [rayon](https://github.com/rayon-rs/rayon), perceptual color mapping, six render modes — all running on pure CPU. Real scenes with 1.1M splats hold 10–25 FPS. No GPU required. Works on potato. Scenes [download](#where-to-get-scenes) included!

<!-- Demo recorded in Ghostty, halfblock mode, no Kitty graphics protocol — pure Unicode characters -->

## Why this exists

Gaussian Splats are cool. Beautiful tech. Especially now with the rise of image-to-splat pipelines like [SHARP](https://github.com/apple/ml-sharp). Btw, it will be soon available [here](#roadmap).

Inspiration by [ratatui](https://github.com/ratatui/ratatui) merged with binge watching of *Common Side Effects* which resulted in building this "The Tortuise" TUI 3GS viewer.

## Features

| Feature | Details |
|---------|---------|
| **6 render modes** | Halfblock (default), point cloud, matrix, block density, braille, ASCII. Cycle with `M` |
| **Full 3D navigation** | WASD movement, R/F vertical, arrow keys for yaw/pitch. Smooth held-key input |
| **Two camera modes** | Free (fly anywhere) and Orbit (auto-rotate around origin). Switch with `Space` |
| **.ply and .splat files** | Standard 3DGS formats. Binary little-endian PLY with SH coefficients, 32-byte .splat records |
| **Built-in scenes** | Bundled `bonsai.splat` (1.1M splats) and `luigi.ply` (14K). `--demo` runs a built-in demo scene |
| **Terminal detection** | Truecolor for modern terminals, perceptual 256-color fallback for Terminal.app. Zero config |
| **Supersampling** | 1x/2x/3x factor for higher fidelity at the cost of compute |
| **Cross-platform** | macOS and Linux |

## Quick start

**Requires Rust 1.80+** (`rustup update` to upgrade)

```bash
# Install from crates.io (recommended)
cargo install tortuise

# Or build from source
git clone https://github.com/4oak/tortuise.git
cd tortuise
cargo install --path .

# Built-in demo (no scene file needed)
tortuise --demo

# Load a bundled scene
tortuise --flip-y scenes/bonsai.splat

# Load any .ply or .splat file
tortuise your-scene.splat
tortuise your-scene.ply

# Some scenes need axis flips depending on capture coordinate system
tortuise --flip-y scene.ply
tortuise --flip-z scene.splat

# Don't have a scene file? Download one from SuperSplat
pip install Pillow numpy  # needed once, for SOG scene format
./scripts/supersplat-dl.sh "https://superspl.at/scene/d281f99f" ramen.ply
tortuise ramen.ply
```

## Supported terminals

**Truecolor (best experience):** Ghostty, iTerm2, Kitty, WezTerm, Alacritty

**256-color fallback:** Apple Terminal.app -- works, but reduced color fidelity. The perceptual color mapping does its best.

Auto-detected via `COLORTERM`, `TERM_PROGRAM`, and `TERM` environment variables. No configuration needed.

## Tested hardware

| Device | CPU | Scene | Reference FPS |
|--------|-----|-------|---------------|
| Mac Mini M4 | Apple M4 | luigi.ply (14K) | 120+ |
| Mac Mini M4 | Apple M4 | bonsai.splat (1.1M) | 80+ |
| MacBook Air M2 | Apple M2 | luigi.ply (14K) | ✓ |
| MacBook Air M2 | Apple M2 | bonsai.splat (1.1M) | 20–30 |
| Jetson Orin Nano* | ARM Cortex-A78AE | luigi.ply (14K) | ~30 |
| Jetson Orin Nano* | ARM Cortex-A78AE | bonsai.splat (1.1M) | 10–15 |

Numbers in parentheses are splat counts. FPS is approximate and depends heavily on terminal window size — a smaller window (⌘-) renders fewer cells and runs faster. *Jetson tested over SSH, which may be a bottleneck.

## Where to get scenes

### SuperSplat (recommended)

The fastest way to get a real scene is from [SuperSplat](https://superspl.at/) -- thousands of community-uploaded Gaussian splat scenes. The included download script handles everything:

```bash
# Download any SuperSplat scene — paste a share URL, scene page URL, or bare ID
./scripts/supersplat-dl.sh "https://superspl.at/scene/d281f99f" ramen.ply
./scripts/supersplat-dl.sh "https://superspl.at/s?id=cf6ac78e" bee.ply
./scripts/supersplat-dl.sh cf6ac78e bee.ply

# View it
tortuise ramen.ply
```

The script auto-detects the scene format and handles both legacy (compressed PLY) and modern (SOG) SuperSplat scenes. No Node.js required — conversion is pure Python.

**Requirements:** Python 3.8+, curl. For SOG scenes (most scenes uploaded after mid-2025), you also need Pillow and numpy:

```bash
pip install -r scripts/requirements.txt
```

### Other sources

- `tortuise --demo` -- instant built-in demo scene, no downloads required
- [Polycam](https://poly.cam/explore) -- photogrammetry captures, some with Gaussian splat export
- [nerfstudio](https://docs.nerf.studio/) -- train your own splats from video, exports to .ply
- Any standard 3DGS pipeline output in .ply or .splat format

Both formats are well-supported: PLY files with spherical harmonic coefficients (`f_dc_0/1/2`) or direct RGB, and the compact 32-byte .splat format used by most web viewers.

## How it works

The pipeline is straightforward: load splats, project them into screen space, depth-sort, splat onto a framebuffer, then convert to terminal characters. Each frame:

1. **Project** -- every Gaussian is transformed from world space through the camera view matrix. Frustum culling drops anything behind the near plane or outside the viewport. This step is parallelized with rayon.
2. **Sort** -- projected splats are depth-sorted back-to-front for correct alpha compositing.
3. **Rasterize** -- each splat is splatted onto an RGB framebuffer using its 2D covariance (scale + rotation). Front-to-back compositing with early alpha termination -- once a pixel is fully opaque, all remaining splats behind it are skipped. Per-splat saturation probes skip entire Gaussians when they land on already-saturated regions. At 1M+ splats, the back 80% are often invisible behind the front 20%.
4. **Encode** -- the framebuffer is converted to terminal output. In halfblock mode, each cell packs two vertical pixels using the `▄` character with separate foreground/background colors. Other modes use braille patterns, ASCII density ramps, or single characters.

The frame target is 8ms (~120fps). On truecolor terminals, colors are passed as 24-bit RGB. On 256-color terminals, a perceptual distance function maps each pixel to the closest ANSI color -- weighted toward green sensitivity, which is where human vision is sharpest.

## Roadmap

Things I want to improve next -- and contribution opportunities:

- **Kitty graphics protocol** -- pixel-perfect rendering via the terminal image protocol. Roughly 18x the resolution of half-block characters. This is the big one.
- **SHARP integration** -- image-to-splat-to-view pipeline. Single photo to 3D in your terminal.
- **Sample scene bundle** -- curated downloadable scenes so people can skip the "where do I find a .splat file" step.
- **GPU acceleration** -- a Metal compute backend exists behind a feature flag, but needs work at higher resolutions. Parked, not abandoned.
- **Performance** -- radix sort for depth ordering, SIMD-accelerated projection via glam, tighter memory layout.

## Built with

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)
- [crossterm](https://github.com/crossterm-rs/crossterm) -- terminal control and input
- [rayon](https://github.com/rayon-rs/rayon) -- data parallelism for projection and rasterization
- [clap](https://github.com/clap-rs/clap) -- CLI argument parsing

[ratatui](https://github.com/ratatui/ratatui) + tortoise = tortuise.
